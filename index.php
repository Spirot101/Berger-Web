					<p>The only real impediment to sucess is yourself and your emotions, boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity. Have faith in the process. The boredom will go away once you enter the cycle. The panic disappears after repreated exposure. The frustration is a sign of progress, a signal that your mind is processing complexity and requires more practice. The insecurities will transform into their opposites when you gain mastery. Trusting this will all happen, you will allow the natural learning process to move forward, and everything else will fall into place.</p>

					<p>To openly dare to meet others perceptions of us is a path that leads to development and makes us better functioning people. A person in harmony is open to the outside world, other people and change. He has a realistic and reasonable view of himself and good relationships.</p>

				<p>When jungles of neurons fire together to support a new thought an additional chemical protein is created within the nerve cell and makes it's way to the center where it lands in the DNA the protein then switches on several
				genes since the job of the genes is to make proteins that maintain both the structure and function of the body
				the nerve cell then quickly makes a new protein to create new branches between nerve cells </p>
