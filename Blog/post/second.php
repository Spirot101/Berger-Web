          <h2>Sucess</h2>
          <p>
            Rather than focusing on fleeting pleasure, find what leads to satisfaction: 
            a purpose in life. Long-lasting achievement, accomplishment, 
            and meaning that will propel you forward in life to thrive.
            <br>
            <br>
            The only real impediment to sucess is yourself and your emotions, boredom, panic, frustration, insecurity. Have faith in the process. The boredom will go away once you enter the cycle. The panic disappears after repreated exposure. The frustration is a sign of progress, a signal that your mind is processing complexity and requires more practice. The insecurities will transform into their opposites when you gain mastery. Trusting this will all happen, you will allow the natural learning process to move forward, and everything else will fall into place.

          To openly dare to meet others perceptions of us is a path that leads to development and makes us better functioning people. A person in harmony is open to the outside world, other people and change. He has a realistic and reasonable view of himself and good relationships.

          <br>
          Your “small self” is a combination of habits, behaviors, and beliefs you adopted from those around you. 
          You interpreted their needs and preferences and took them as your own. You assumed certain traits for defense,
          or safety, or because you just never took a minute to stop and think: But is this really who I am?
